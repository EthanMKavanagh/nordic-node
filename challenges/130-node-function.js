// it takes 2 dogs to pull the sleigh when it is empty
// it takes 2 more dogs to pull each additional box

// divide the number of boxes by 2, then add 2
// if the input number was 2, the result should be 3

module.exports = function (numberOfBoxes) {
    // YOUR CODE HERE

}

// now run `node test.js` in the terminal, to see what happens
